Cubes from left to right:<br>
1:Standard cube with shader with interpolating colors<br>
2:Interpolating between red and yellow and x axis<br>
3:Standard cube with phong material<br>
4:cube with distance material, was not able to change color for some reason<br>

	a: x = 8(width of texture) * U<br>
	b: y = 8(height of texture) - v * 8(height of texture)<br>
	c: White Grid<br>
	<br>
Cubes Left to Right<br>
Cube1: Use texture and map #196, followed doc instructions<br>
Cube2: Use original material of Cube1<br>
Cube3: Use texture and map #176 by following doc instructions<br>
Cube4: Used shader to make texture instead of THREE.js. Used #165<br>
Cube5: Same steps as Cube4 with #177. To complete the challenge I did modulo funciton by 0.5 in fragmentshader2.frag.

I used what we learned in part a and b and attempted to create snowflakes falling down fast to create a snowstorm.

I tried to make a material similar to the smoothie I had. I played around with the Albedo and color to replicate the inside of my drink. The material is on the sphere in the scene.
<br>Spotlight:Light shines in a single direction and is affected by position and rotation
<br>Area Light: Emits light from a side of a plane and only works when baked in a lightmap.
<br>Point Light: Light shines in all directions. Is not affected by rotation but position is malleable.
<br>Directional Light: Light shines in a single direction and is like the sun. Affects all objects. Direction is changed through rotation.
<br>
<br>
Skybox: I  downloaded an asset from unity and added the material to the skybox. It looks like the daytime.
<br>
Textures: I used the brick texture for the walls and a grassy bush texture for the floor.
